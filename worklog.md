## Current Project Status Assessment

### Build & Quality
- **Build**: ✅ Passes (next build, 20 routes, 143 source files)
- **Lint**: ✅ Passes (1 harmless React Hook Form compatibility warning, 0 errors)
- **TypeScript**: ✅ Strict mode, zero errors
- **No `any`**: ✅ Verified (rg search returns 0 results)
- **No `console.log`**: ✅ Verified (rg search returns 0 results)
- **No `@ts-ignore`**: ✅ Verified (rg search returns 0 results)
- **No dead code**: ✅ Verified
- **No unused packages**: ✅ 16 removed initially, no new unused added

### 3 Complete Gateways
1. **Public** (wafir.gleeze.com): Home, Facilities, Facility Detail, Register, 404 — Netflix-style UX
2. **Owner** (facility.wafir.gleeze.com): Login, My Facilities, Facility Edit, Products CRUD, Excel Import
3. **Admin** (admin.wafir.gleeze.com): Dashboard (8 stats), Regions, Cards, Facilities (14-field form), Users (role mgmt), Audit Logs

### Visual Enhancements This Round
- Cinema-quality hero with animated gradients, floating blobs, gradient text, sparkles
- Password strength indicator, confetti on registration success
- ScrollToTop FAB, Online/Offline detection banner
- Admin/Owner login pages redesigned with branding
- Product cards with hover lift + shadow effects
- Category count badges on facility detail
- Metadata exports for SEO on all pages


## Unresolved Issues
1. BLOCKER: POST /api/v1/owner/login doesn't exist (see BLOCKERS.md)
2. BLOCKER: CORS not configured for 3 domains (see BLOCKERS.md)
3. Dashboard API returns empty schema - frontend assumes 8 stat fields
4. No user role filter param - client-side filtering for owner select
5. No facility search param - client-side filtering
6. ESLint: 1 harmless react-hooks/incompatible-library warning (React Hook Form + React 19)

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Backend**: Add owner/login endpoint and configure CORS for 3 domains
2. **Testing**: End-to-end browser testing of all 3 gateways (especially owner flow)
3. **Verification**: Confirm dashboard API response fields match DashboardStats type
4. **Performance**: Lazy loading for admin/owner pages with next/dynamic
5. **Lighthouse**: Mobile performance audit targeting ≥90
6. **Enhancement**: Add real facility/region data screenshots for visual validation
7. **UX**: Add loading skeleton for facility detail page (currently only shows skeleton while fetching facilities list, not individual facility)
8. **i18n**: All error messages from api-client should be confirmed against actual backend responses in production

Task ID: 14
Agent: Public Gateway Enhancement Agent
Task: Public Gateway Feature & Style Enhancements (Round 3)

Work Log:
- **Testimonials Section** (homepage): Added horizontal scrollable row of 6 testimonial cards below HowItWorks. Each card has: colored circle avatar with Arabic initial, user name, city, 5 gold Star icons, review text. Cards use `gradient-border-animated` class for subtle gradient border on hover, plus `hover:scale-[1.02]` and `hover:shadow-lg` effects. Section titled 'ماذا يقول مستخدمونا' with MessageSquareQuote icon.
- **Enhanced Mobile Bottom Nav**: Converted NAV_ITEMS to typed `NavItem[]` interface. The 'انضم' (register) button now renders as a prominent circular primary-colored button with `bg-primary` circle, `shadow-lg shadow-primary/30`, and `textShadow` glow effect. Added pulsing dot indicator (h-2 w-2 bg-primary animate-pulse) on the 'الرئيسية' (Home) icon via `hasBadge` property.
- **NProgress-style Top Loading Bar** (CSS only): Added `nprogress-loading` CSS keyframe animation (0% → 80% width, then snap to 100% and fade out). Created `RouteLoadingBar` component in `providers.tsx` that listens to `usePathname()` changes, renders a 3px fixed bar with primary pink gradient background. Bar auto-hides after 900ms. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. No external library needed.
- **Facility Detail Enhancements**:
  - Added 'مشاركة' (Share) button in info bar using Share2 icon. Copies current URL to clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`, shows toast 'تم نسخ الرابط', and temporarily shows Check icon with success color.
  - Added 'إبلاغ' (Report) button with Flag icon that opens a Dialog from `@/components/ui/dialog` with title 'إبلاغ عن منشأة', description 'سيتم مراجعة البلاغ واتخاذ الإجراء المناسب', and 'حسنًا' OK button. Hover turns destructive red.
  - Added sticky bottom bar on mobile (`fixed bottom-16 md:hidden`) showing 'احصل على خصم 30%' text with 'تسجيل' CTA button linking to /register. Uses `bg-card/95 backdrop-blur-md`.
  - Added `mb-20 md:mb-0` to back link to prevent sticky bar overlap on mobile.
- **Welcome Banner**: Created `WelcomeBanner` component using `useSyncExternalStore` to read from sessionStorage (avoids React Compiler lint error for setState-in-effect). Shows dismissible banner at top of public layout: 'مرحبًا بك في وفر! سجّل واحصل على خصم 30% فوري' with 'تسجيل' button and X close button. Dismissal sets `wafir_welcome_dismissed` in sessionStorage. Public layout converted to client component to support this.
- **Facilities Page Sort**: Added `SortKey` type ('default' | 'newest' | 'alpha') and `SORT_OPTIONS` array. Added sort toggle buttons next to filter chips with ArrowUpDown icon. 'الأحدث' sorts by `b.id - a.id`, 'الأبجدي' sorts by `localeCompare('ar')`. Active sort button uses `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`. Filter chips and sort buttons arranged in responsive flex layout (stacked on mobile, row on desktop). Motion grid key updated to include sortKey for re-animation.
- **globals.css**: Added `nprogress-loading` keyframe and `.nprogress-bar` class with reduced-motion support.
- All text is Arabic, no emojis, no `any`, no `@ts-ignore`, no `console.log`.
- All touch targets meet min-h-[44px] requirement.
- TypeScript: 0 errors. Lint: 0 new errors (1 pre-existing React Hook Form warning).

Stage Summary:
- 7 files modified/created: page.tsx (home), MobileBottomNav.tsx, providers.tsx, FacilityDetailContent.tsx, WelcomeBanner.tsx (new), layout.tsx (public), FacilitiesContent.tsx, globals.css
- 6 features implemented: Testimonials, Enhanced Mobile Nav, Loading Bar, Facility Detail Share/Report/CTA, Welcome Banner, Facilities Sort

Agent: Admin Gateway Enhancement Agent
Task: Admin Gateway Feature & Style Enhancements (Round 3)

Work Log:
- **Admin Dashboard - Recent Users Widget** (`src/app/(admin)/admin/page.tsx`):
  - Added `useAdminUsers` hook import and call with `(undefined, 1, 5)` to fetch 5 most recent users.
  - Added `Badge` import and role badge config (ROLE_LABELS, ROLE_COLORS, ROLE_ICONS) matching UsersTable styles.
  - Added new section 'آخر العملاء المسجلين' below recent activity section.
  - Shows each user with: avatar icon (Users in secondary color), full name, email (LTR), role badge (colored per role), and formatted date.
  - Loading state shows Skeleton placeholders (circle, name, email, badge, date).
  - Empty state shows 'لا يوجد عملاء مسجلين بعد.'
- **Admin Regions Page Enhancement** (`src/app/(admin)/admin/regions/page.tsx`):
  - Added visual stats row at top: 'إجمالي المناطق' (total regions count) and 'مناطق تحتوي منشآت' (regions with facilities count).
  - Added `useAdminFacilities(1, 200)` hook to cross-reference facilities with regions.
  - Computed `facilityCountByRegion` Map and `regionsWithFacilities` count using `useMemo`.

- **Admin Audit Logs Enhancement** (`src/components/admin/AuditTable.tsx` and `src/app/(admin)/admin/audit-logs/page.tsx`):
  - Added expandable row feature: clicking a row with details toggles an expand/collapse button (ChevronDown/Up). Expanded row shows full JSON in a `pre/code` block with RTL-safe `dir="ltr"`.
  - Added action type filter dropdown using `Select` component from `@/components/ui/select`. Extracts unique action types from data and maps to labels via `getAuditLabel`.

  - Renamed 'المنشآت' column header to 'المنشآت المشتركة'.
  - Added published status filter chips at top (الكل / منشورة / مسودة) using `Button` with `rounded-full`.

Task: Project Status Assessment, QA Testing, Bug Fix, and Enhancement Coordination

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md (480 lines) to understand full project history (Phases 0-8 + 2 enhancement rounds)
- Performed server-based QA testing of all 11 routes via curl:
  - / -> 200, /facilities -> 200, /register -> 200
  - /admin -> 307 (auth redirect, correct), /admin/login -> 200
  - /owner -> 307 (auth redirect, correct), /owner/login -> 200
  - /nonexistent -> 404 (correct), /sitemap.xml -> 200, /manifest.webmanifest -> 200
- Found and fixed 2 bugs:
  - Bug 1: robots.txt returning 500 — `src/app/robots.ts` had `rules` as an object instead of array (Next.js 14+ requires array format). Fixed by wrapping in array.
  - Bug 2: Conflicting `public/robots.txt` static file shadowed dynamic `src/app/robots.ts`. Deleted `public/robots.txt`. Verified /robots.txt now returns 200 with correct content.
- Coordinated 3 parallel subagents for comprehensive Round 3 enhancements:
  - **Public Gateway** (Task 14): Testimonials section (6 cards, gradient borders, gold stars), enhanced mobile nav (prominent register CTA, pulsing dot), NProgress-style loading bar (CSS only, 3px gradient), facility detail (Share/Report buttons, sticky mobile CTA), Welcome Banner (dismissible, sessionStorage), Facilities sort (default/newest/alpha)
  - **Admin Gateway** (Task 15): Dashboard recent users widget (5 latest), Regions page (stats row, facility counts, color cycling borders), Audit logs (expandable rows, JSON detail, action filter dropdown, total count), Cards page (published filter chips, colored circle preview, facility count column), Sidebar count badges (4 nav items, rounded-full primary badges)
  - **Owner Gateway** (Task 16): Products search clear button + filtered count, Facility edit image preview + external link, Product form (image preview, clear fields, char counts), Import columns checklist + rules card, Quick Actions section (stagger animation)
- Post-agent verification:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` = 0 errors
  - `bun run lint` = 0 errors (1 pre-existing React Hook Form warning)
  - No `: any`, no `@ts-ignore`, no `console.log`
  - All routes verified: 200/307/404 correct status codes

Stage Summary:
- 2 bugs fixed (robots.ts format, conflicting public file)
- 17+ files modified across all 3 gateways
- 16 new features/enhancements added
- All quality checks pass: TS, lint, code rules
- 1 new component created: WelcomeBanner.tsx
- 1 new CSS animation: nprogress-loading

- Deleted conflicting public/robots.txt

### Unresolved Issues
1. BLOCKER: POST /api/v1/owner/login doesn't exist (see BLOCKERS.md)
2. BLOCKER: CORS not configured for 3 domains (see BLOCKERS.md)
3. Dashboard API returns empty schema — frontend assumes 8 stat fields
4. No user role filter param — client-side filtering for owner select
5. No facility search param — client-side filtering
6. ESLint: 1 harmless react-hooks/incompatible-library warning (React Hook Form + React 19)
7. Middleware deprecation warning: Next.js 16 recommends "proxy" over "middleware"

### Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Backend**: Add owner/login endpoint and configure CORS for 3 domains
2. **Migration**: Convert middleware.ts to proxy.ts per Next.js 16 recommendation
3. **Performance**: Lazy loading for admin/owner pages with next/dynamic
4. **Lighthouse**: Mobile performance audit targeting >= 90
5. **Facility Detail**: Individual facility API endpoint (currently finds facility from full list)
6. **Real-time**: WebSocket notifications for owner product updates
7. **PWA**: Service worker and offline support for the customer gateway
8. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation audit and ARIA improvements

Task ID: 19
Agent: Main Orchestrator (Round 5 — QA, Bug Fix, Enhancement Coordination)
Task: Project Status Assessment, Browser QA, Bug Fix, and Round 5 Enhancement Coordination

Work Log:
- Read full worklog.md (698 lines) to understand complete project history (Phases 0-8 + 4 enhancement rounds)
- Performed TypeScript and lint verification: 0 TS errors, 1 pre-existing warning
- Tested all gateway routes via curl: / (200, 101KB), /facilities (200), /register (200), /admin/login (200), /owner/login (200), /admin/settings (307), /owner/settings (307), /nonexistent (404)
- Browser QA via agent-browser:
  - Homepage: All sections visible (hero, search, FAQ, testimonials, contact, promo banner, footer, mobile nav)
  - Admin login: Form renders correctly with all fields
  - Mobile bottom nav: Shows 4 items correctly (الرئيسية, المنشآت, كيف تعمل, انضم)
  - API unreachable in sandbox (expected) - frontend handles gracefully with retry buttons
  - Region selector retry button visible (API CORS/network restriction)
- Fixed 1 bug:
  - `FacilitiesContent.tsx`: `setRecentSearches` called synchronously inside useEffect triggered React Compiler lint error. Fixed by using lazy initializer `useState<string[]>(() => loadRecentSearches())` instead of useEffect
- Created owner settings page at `src/app/(owner)/owner/settings/page.tsx` (was just a nav link, now a full page)
- Coordinated 4 parallel subagents for Round 5 enhancements:
  - **Global CSS** (Task 3): Smooth scroll, branded skeleton shimmer, enhanced focus rings, selection color, scrollbar hover, card-glow class, text utilities, noise texture overlay, input focus glow, extended reduced-motion
  - **Public Gateway** (Task 2-a): Cookie consent banner (localStorage, AnimatePresence), recent searches (localStorage, max 5, chips with clear), enhanced register page (decorative side panel, gradient border, separators), product quick view modal (Dialog with image/details/price), ScrollToTop enhancement (bounce, tooltip, shadow), WelcomeBanner enhancement (shimmer button, rotate close)
  - **Admin Gateway** (Task 2-b): CSV export utility with BOM, CSV export buttons on users and audit-logs pages, pagination info text ("عرض X من Y"), regions search/filter, cards search + statistics badges, dashboard recent facilities widget
  - **Owner Gateway** (Task 2-c): Facility switcher dropdown in sidebar, recent products widget, import error CSV export, grid/list view toggle for products, enhanced empty state with contact CTA
- Post-agent verification:
  - npx tsc --noEmit = 0 errors
  - bun run lint = 0 errors (1 pre-existing React Hook Form warning)
  - No `: any`, no `@ts-ignore`, no `console.log` (verified across 146 source files)
  - All routes verified: 200/307/404 correct status codes

Stage Summary:
- 1 bug fixed (recent searches setState-in-effect lint error)
- 1 new page created: owner/settings
- 1 new utility: csv-export.ts

### Unresolved Issues
1. BLOCKER: POST /api/v1/owner/login doesn't exist (see BLOCKERS.md)
2. BLOCKER: CORS not configured for 3 domains (see BLOCKERS.md)
3. Dashboard API returns empty schema — frontend assumes 8 stat fields
4. No user role filter param — client-side filtering
5. No facility search param — client-side filtering
6. ESLint: 1 harmless react-hooks/incompatible-library warning (React Hook Form + React 19)
7. Middleware deprecation warning: Next.js 16 recommends "proxy" over "middleware"
8. Dev server instability in sandbox environment

### Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Backend**: Add owner/login endpoint and configure CORS
2. **Migration**: Convert middleware.ts to proxy.ts per Next.js 16
3. **Performance**: Lazy loading for admin/owner pages with next/dynamic
4. **PWA**: Service worker and offline support
5. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation audit
6. **i18n**: Verify all error messages match actual backend responses
7. **Testing**: End-to-end browser testing with real API
8. **Real-time**: WebSocket notifications for owner updates

### New Features This Round (30+ total)
- **Global**: Shared constants (TYPE_LABEL/ICON, SCHEMA_ORG_TYPE), shared useDebounce hook, 7 new CSS utilities, apiClient dual auth clearing, ImageWithSkeleton fallback, DiscountBadge edge case
- **Bug Fixes**: 11 fixes (English text, aria-sort, setState-in-effect, role=alert, checkbox wiring, clipboard fallback, QR text)
- **Public**: Testimonials marquee, promo countdown banner, scroll progress FAB, product count badges, region pulse indicator, hero grid/3D card, scroll row underlines, footer newsletter glow
- **Admin**: Status filter tabs, notification preferences, action filter, stat card gradients/hover/trends, sidebar gradient indicator, login shimmer border, table alternating rows, user detail dialog refinements
- **Owner**: Product stats summary, batch delete dialog, enhanced image grid, notification preferences, sidebar gradient indicator

### Unresolved Issues
1. BLOCKER: POST /api/v1/owner/login doesn't exist (see BLOCKERS.md)
2. BLOCKER: CORS not configured for 3 domains (see BLOCKERS.md)
3. Dashboard API returns empty schema — frontend assumes 8 stat fields
4. No user role filter param — client-side filtering
5. No facility search param — client-side filtering
6. ESLint: 1 harmless react-hooks/incompatible-library warning (React Hook Form + React 19)
7. Middleware deprecation warning: Next.js 16 recommends "proxy" over "middleware"
8. Dev server instability in sandbox environment (server process dies intermittently)
9. Hardcoded 30% discount — should use card.discount_rate from API
10. Favorites are client-state only — not persisted to backend
11. QR code is decorative SVG, not a real scannable QR
12. Settings save handlers are stub toasts (admin + owner)
13. Hardcoded profile data in settings (admin + owner)
14. Admin notifications are static mock data
15. N+1 API queries on owner dashboard (should be single endpoint)

### Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. **Backend**: Add owner/login endpoint and configure CORS
2. **Migration**: Convert middleware.ts to proxy.ts per Next.js 16
3. **Performance**: Lazy loading for admin/owner pages with next/dynamic
4. **PWA**: Service worker and offline support for customer gateway
5. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation audit
6. **Real-time**: WebSocket notifications for owner updates
7. **Advanced UI**: Virtual scrolling for large tables, data export improvements
8. **Dynamic discounts**: Use card.discount_rate from API instead of hardcoded 30%
9. **Real QR codes**: Replace decorative SVG with actual QR code library
